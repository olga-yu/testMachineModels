2. Neural Networks - adapted from Natalia Yerashenia https://github.com/Yerashenia/Predictive-Computational-Model-PCM/tree/master/Market_Index_Prediction

3. Data transform takes place in data_transform.py to transform original textual data into numbered data
- the data is saved to result_output.csv
- data preprocessing  with data2017.csv
-- attendance is sorted against possible bigger and larger rooms
-- attendance trend is  reviewed closer to the end of semester
- comparison is made to original lecture and tutorial sorting and possible bigger and smaller lecture
# bigger and smaller size tutorial size rooms instead
4. CAP_NN.py - contains neural network that should produce predicted attendance, but produces. [[1.]]
5. CAP_NN_testing - test against  new data result_output.csv, compare results MAE, MSE.
- Compare predictions against actual results, but it predictions do not exist
- produce graphs
6. the time is divided into following groups in the realdata.csv
11:00-12:59 - 1
13:00-14:59 - 2
15:00-16:59 - 3
17:00-18:59 - 4
